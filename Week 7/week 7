Cross selling recommendation - Group Project

How to increase cross selling of Banking Products
Problem Statement:  XYZ credit union in Latin America is performing very well in selling the Banking products (eg: Credit card, deposit account, retirement account, 
safe deposit box etc) but their existing customer is not not buying more than 1 product which means bank is not performing good in cross selling (Bank is not 
able to sell their other offerings to existing customer). XYZ Credit Union decided to approach ABC analytics to solve their problem. Can you tell us how this 
can be solved?   ( In real world you will be thrown problems like this  ;) )
